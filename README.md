# Personal-Blog-with-Markdown-Support
A personal blog platform where users can read posts, and the admin (blog owner) can create, edit, and delete posts using Markdown. Posts and comments are stored in Firestore, and users can comment on blog posts. The blog should be publicly visible, but post creation and management are restricted to the admin.
